    <strong>Automotive SPICE<br />
    </strong>Software quality is notoriously difficult to measure. To ensure that the software is of a high level of
    quality, the development process must enforce practices that lead to high quality software. In automotive software
    development, this can be done following the roadmap of work products set out by the Automotive SPICE standard.
    Importantly, the Automotive SPICE standard does not enforce an actual software development process. This allows room
    for software development processes to implement the standard in different ways.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Agile</strong><br />
    Outside of the automotive industry, software development is commonly done according to an Agile process, most notably
    Scrum. Core values in Agile processes are fast iterations, growing the software feature-by-feature, self organisation
    within the development team, and embracing changing requirements. These values, when applied in a Scrum process, offer
    great advatages in terms of development speed, team efficiency, and software quality.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>BRACE process</strong><br />
    In the automotive industry, however, a 'pure' Scrum process would be impractical. Contraints imposed by the Automotive
    SPICE standard, Functional Safety, and the realities of developing hardware and software simultaneously require a
    taylored approach to automotive software development.<br />
    <br />
    This process intends to apply Agile principles to industry-standard software development practices. To achieve that,
    the software development process has been constructed from three types of building blocks; Roles, Work products, and
    Tasks. In keeping with the values of both Agile and Automotive SPICE,&nbsp;this allows the process to be taylored and
    improved.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Roles<br />
    </strong>A role in a software development process does not refer to an individual or to a position in the organisation.
    It refers to a set of responsibilities and tasks that may be transferred freely to other team members. In practice,
    however, team members may specialise in one particular role. A clear description of the role’s responsibilities and
    tasks is very important to allow the role to be transferred easily. A major obstacle to efficiency and maintaining flow
    is being unsure what to do. By explicitly defining the responsibilities and tasks involvement for each role, this
    uncertainty can be removed.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Work products</strong><br />
    Beside the code, unit tests etc., there are many work products. Any document or design schematic can be a work product.
    Each work product has a clear description and quality standards. Each work product is the responsibility of one role.
    Templates can be defined for work products to improve uniformity and efficiency.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Tasks</strong><br />
    A task is any process activity that can be scheduled. Each task has a detailed step plan. This allows new engineers to
    get up to speed quickly, with minimum mentoring. Well-defined tasks make it easier to estimate time and risk for each
    phase of the process. This allows effective time/team management. Each task has a clear purpose in the process. This
    prevents process steps being skipped because they are deemed ‘not important’.</span>
