to determine how effectively the project was run, to learn lessons for the future, and to ensure that the organization gets
the greatest possible benefit from the project.<br />
After a long project, the last thing many project teams want to do is relive the process and look for ways to improve.
However, a forward-looking review can discover many tips and strategies for improvement.<br />
By conducting a thorough and timely project review, key lessons learned can be identified and they can then be applied to
the planning and management of future projects.</td>

    1. Introduction<br />
    Completing a project is not the same thing as ending the project management process. Simply finishing doesn't ensure
    that the organization benefits from the project's outcome. To make the most of the benefits that the project can
    deliver, however, you also need to check to see if further improvements will deliver still greater benefit.
</p>
<p>
    It is also key to ensure that the lessons learned during the project are not forgotten. Design and execution can be
    more effectively, when taking advantage of lessons learned through experience of previous projects.
</p>
<p>
    2. When to Review<br />
    A good time to start thinking about the Project Review is when members of the project team remember the most â€“ shortly
    after the project has been delivered, and when most of the problems have been resolved. Start to list ideas and
    observations while they are still fresh in people's minds.
</p>
<p>
    However, to adequately assess the quality of the implementation and complete this process, it is preffered to&nbsp;
    wait long enough for the changes caused by the project to truly take effect. There will probably be a period of
    adjustment before&nbsp; the solution can be be reviewed as it was intended to operate.
</p>
<p>
    3. What to Review<br />
    When conducting the review, a series of topics need to be addressed. The project charter needs to be evaluated to
    identify how closely the project results match the original objectives as well as the expected deliverables (including
    documentation) to ensure either that these have been delivered to an acceptable level of quality or that an acceptable
    substitute is in place.
</p>
<p>
    Another important factor is the satisfaction of stakeholders. Meeting all objectives and deliverables will not always
    mean that the stakeholders are satisfied.
</p>
<p>
    4. How to Review<br />
    Define the scope of the review and clarify the objectives for the review. This will ensure that people share their
    experiences openly and honestly.<br />
    Gather the key project documents. This will help to assess the project planning process, as well as the actual benefits
    achieved through the project. Where possible, use outside people in the review process to get an objective, unclouded
    view of the project. Sometimes it is recommended using only independent people in the review, however, the perspectives
    of those who were directly involved in the project can also provide insights.<br />
    Report the findings, and publicize the results. The Project review is designed to aid project managers conduct more
    effective projects in the future, as well as to measure and optimize the benefits of the specific project being
    reviewed.&nbsp; This can be supported by presenting detailed recommendations to the organization and the project
    leaders, as well as to customers and other stakeholders.
